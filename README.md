# ARK: Survival Evolved Linux Server Tools

## Pre-requisites

To install ARK Server Tools you must have already installed **SteamCMD** following this guide:

https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD#Linux

We assume you have created the `steam` user to store steamcmd and your ARK server.

## Requirements
Use this command to install soft requirement on your system
```
apt-get install screen unzip
```

Edit /etc/sysctl.conf and set:
```
fs.file-max=100000
```
Edit /etc/security/limits.conf and set these limits:
```
* soft nofile 100000
* hard nofile 100000
```
Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/common-session:
```
session required pam_limits.so
```

## Install ARK Server Tools

To install ARK Server Tools run these commands:

```sh
cd ~
wget https://github.com/FezVrasta/ark-server-tools/archive/master.tar.gz
tar -zxvf master.tar.gz
cd ark-server-tools-master/tools
chmod u+x install.sh
sudo sh install.sh steam
```

NB: You may want to change the `install.sh` parameter to fit your steam user if different from `steam`.

This will copy the `arkmanager` and the `arkdaemon` to the proper directories and will create an empty log directory in `/var/log` for ARK Server Tools.

## Configure ARK Server

All the needed variables are stored in the /etc/arkmanager/arkmanager.cfg configuration file change them following the comments.
